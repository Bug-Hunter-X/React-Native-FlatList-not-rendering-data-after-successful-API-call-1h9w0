# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data after a successful API call.  The API call completes without errors, but the FlatList remains empty.  The provided solution addresses this problem.

## Problem

The `MyComponent` attempts to fetch data from an API endpoint and display it using a FlatList.  While the API call is successful (as indicated by the absence of error messages), the FlatList remains empty after the loading indicator disappears.

## Solution

The issue arises from the keyExtractor function not properly providing unique keys for the list items.  The solution uses a more robust key generation strategy ensuring that every item has a unique identifier, which addresses the rendering problem.
